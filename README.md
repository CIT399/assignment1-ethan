"# assignment1-ethan" 

In this assignment, the source code is to be reviewed and checked for inconsistencies with common Java coding standards.  It is then to be forked, reviewed, and corrected.
Look for comments as for where the violations of the coding standards are.  There should be 5 of them.

Good luck,

Ethan Yoder
